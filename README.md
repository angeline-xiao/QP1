# QP1

Qualifying project on Murray, J. S. (2018). Multiple Imputation: a Review of Practical and Theoretical Findings. Statistical Science 33(2), 142-159. with Lang Wu. 


QP 1.Rmd: Code file for all simulations

NLSdata.RData: Data file with the initial NLS of Youth 1997 cohort data (from https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97) needed for running the simulation. Note that variables and rows have been carefully cleaning and selected so that we have a faux-complete data set and no real conclusions should be main from this data. 


Warning: simulations take a long time (about 1.5 hours) to run, so I wouldn't recommend rerunning them. I have a copy of the full environment after running but it too large (around 300MB) to upload into Github, I can file transfer on request.
